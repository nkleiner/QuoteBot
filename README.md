Quote Bot is a discord bot written in Python designed to give server owners the ability to offer a fun, self-hosted, reliable quote service to their communities that requires NO CODING KNOWLEDGE. Enjoy the fun of Quote Bot with no need for any programming experience and the privacy of owning your own quote database. Quote Bot is given a dedicated quote channel to monitor for submissions. When quotes are added it will store them in a local database on the users host machine, making it a part of the quote pull users can request from. Upon a successful quote submission the bot will thumbs up your quote, or if there is a problem it will thumbs down the quote. It features a variety of commands, including the "!quote" command that allows discord server members to request a random quote from Quote Bot. Users can get a little more specific by specifiying "!quote *Author Name*" and Quote Bot will attempt to retrieve a random quote from the user specified author. Other fun features include the "!inspire" command which pulls a random inspirational quote from an existing database, and the ability to request a reset to the existing database where quote bot will automatically gather all available quotes in your quote channel and create a fresh copy of the database ensuring you have all the most recent quotes.
